# Module 4 Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to use Jupyter Notebooks to manipulate dataframes with functions and methods native to pandas.

## Code Details
The repository has two main files:  
1. The `Resources` folder in which the CSV/data source is for our Notebook
2. The `module_4_challenge.ipynb` which is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code.

### Special Note
Even though we have learned about list comprehensions in class, the list comprehension mechanism in the second to last cell of the notebook was inspired by a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41271673/format-numbers-in-pandas-as-currency-in-thousands-or-millions) answer I found online.  I formatted the comprehension for it to be my own and applicable to the assignment.
